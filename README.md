# ATTENTION, PT FRIENDS/PLAYERS!
## everything below the this is all the pt/interaction info, i dont plan to update/change it currently, so ignore the part where it says "daily" until i fully come back.
i used to play daily until something happened on June 13th that i need to heal from. i come back for events and sometimes to just check in with my friends for now, maybe interact with fandom etc. usual stuff... although, someday ill probably be back fully! i just need a bit more time to heal. i dont know when ill be back fully, i do miss this game but its difficult. if you still want to contact me, please add me on discord: [@anthonyscoffin](https://discordid.netlify.app/?id=471151816688533535)... thank you for reading! see you around when i can.

# PONY TOWN INFO.·êü ![pony town](https://file.garden/ZNjY5-CbZ0o-GQoj/favicon-16x16.png)

## **GENERAL.·êü** ![gen](https://supplies.ju.mp/assets/images/gallery05/a6e671c2_original.gif?v=6a50b904)
- i **USED** to play pony town daily (400+ days of playtime), i have been playing since 2017 (daily since june of 2018 not counting breaks), ive gotten less frequent but i want to get back in again, maybe someday, but ive been pretty busy these days spending time with my boyfriend and friends outside of this game
- im very friendly so feel free to interact! im very shy but also very hyper, i can get out of hand sometimes, dont be scared to correct me when im wrong!
- i like to yap about my favorite things a lot, especially music, so PLEASE talk to me about music or fandom if we share any, i LOVE that!
- i am often multitasking so theres a 50/50 chance that i am offtab but im still quite responsive i think!
- i use slurs i can reclaim and i make kms jokes, if this makes you uncomfortable please tell me!

- one big thing with me is i want to know when im wrong or out of line, so if i upset you or make you uncomfortable at all, ***PLEASE*** tell me i am ***BEGGING*** you, it is VERY much appreciated, i am open to criticism. it is not a bad or scary thing, and is often neccasary i feel. im making this clear because of past experiences (see: 2024, iykyk), i want to be a good person, i dont want to make anyone upset or ruin a life, ya'know? thank you for understanding...

## **STATUS MEANINGS.·êü** ![warning](https://vermillion.drr.ac/assets/images/gallery01/404ff162.gif?v=9b7c387b)
- Online ‚≠í literally never enabled.
- Looking for chat ‚≠í open to chat, i usually dont enable this unless im actively seeking out a specific fandom or kind of interaction
- Looking for roleplay ‚≠í as it reads, looking for a lab most likely... (very rare as i dont rlly rp anymore)
- Away ‚≠í i have this on often, i like the little moon symbol <3
- Busy ‚≠í i dont put this on often, usually only when im upset or busy/want to be left alone more. so dont interact unless i do or if youre a friend, basically

## **BEFORE YOU INTERACT.·êü** ![warning](https://64.media.tumblr.com/fd3ebb8f4374f0ff470173bdf3720e21/e92e724d08501b36-d2/s75x75_c1/4c4bf1733ae1c5cdf39a7c8bc6614a42332a366f.gif)
- as mentioned, im pretty shy so i might go quiet or get overwhelmed with new people, so be patient with me
- i may not respond right away if i am offtab but i try my best too, im almost always multitasking
- i am pretty blunt, if you upset me i will not be afraid to call you out.
- i will not be afraid to hide you if you annoy me, at this point i hide freely; following my own dni and yours (even the "*hidden*" parts of my dni).

## **DO NOT INTERACT + DO'S AND DON'TS.·êü** ![angry](https://64.media.tumblr.com/48d355ab2558992c964aaa251de9c7fb/7d4346d1477298e1-3c/s75x75_c1/ab4a72a28910a0ccc108891bc1f0c24414ce36ca.gif)
- please for the love of god if you have a problem with me and or my skins or WHATEVER, ***HIDE ME***. do not insult me, hide me and move on... shouldnt have to be said/asked.
- fall under my [dni](https://rentry.co/dniscoffin)
- do **NOT** interact if you are the type to copy skins, do not copy my skins. *you may take inspo*, but ***DO NOT*** copy despite how "*simple*" my style is.
- if you are the type to **send death threats** or **harass people viciously instead of muting and blocking** like a normal mature person, ***i want nothing to do with you***. do better.
- please do not cover me if i do not know you. i will hide you if i feel/can tell its malicious (usually for 24 hours).
- please do not compare my OC's to canonical characters from another media.

## **CONTINUED BOUNDARIES.·êü** ![mad](https://vermillion.drr.ac/assets/images/gallery01/2bc55952.gif?v=9b7c387b)
- i dont mind boops, but they are not a way to get my attention. if you want my attention, whisper me or speak, i usually dont respond to just "hi" though, so be creative!
- i love crowns (üëë) or compliments! feel free to! though, do it in whisper in case i dont see it (if you can, sometimes theyre disabled because of harrassment, but not often!)
- i am happily taken by my lovely boyfriend, so i would prefer if you dont flirt with me or anything like that! this is a pony game, not a dating game.
