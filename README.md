## **GENERAL.ᐟ** ![gen](https://supplies.ju.mp/assets/images/gallery05/a6e671c2_original.gif?v=6a50b904)
- i play pony town daily (400+ days of playtime), i have been playing since 2017 (daily since june of 2018 not counting breaks) and i will not tolerate shit anymore. im tired.
- im very friendly so feel free to interact unless you are a troll or just rude. i will snap back <3
- i am often multitasking so theres a 50/50 chance that i am offtab but im still quite responsive i think!
- i use slurs i can reclaim and i make kms jokes, if this makes you uncomfy please tell me!

## **STATUS MEANINGS.ᐟ** ![warning](https://vermillion.drr.ac/assets/images/gallery01/404ff162.gif?v=9b7c387b)
- Online ⭒ literally never enabled.
- Looking for chat ⭒ open to chat, not enabled often anymore.
- Looking for roleplay ⭒ as it reads, looking for a lab most likely...
- Away ⭒ i have this on often, i like the little moon symbol <3
- Busy ⭒ please do not interact unless you are a friend, or if i interact first.

## **BEFORE YOU INTERACT.ᐟ** ![warning](https://64.media.tumblr.com/fd3ebb8f4374f0ff470173bdf3720e21/e92e724d08501b36-d2/s75x75_c1/4c4bf1733ae1c5cdf39a7c8bc6614a42332a366f.gif)
- i may not respond right away if i am offtab but i try my best too, im almost always multitasking.
- i am pretty blunt, if you piss me off im not afraid to call you out. i will snap back if you overstep a boundary.
- i will not be afraid to hide you if you piss me off, at this point i hide freely; following my own dni and yours.

## **DO NOT INTERACT + DO'S AND DON'TS.ᐟ** ![angry](https://64.media.tumblr.com/48d355ab2558992c964aaa251de9c7fb/7d4346d1477298e1-3c/s75x75_c1/ab4a72a28910a0ccc108891bc1f0c24414ce36ca.gif)
- please for the love of god if you have a problem with me and or my skins or WHATEVER, ***HIDE ME***. do not insult me, hide me. i am sick and fucking tired of your shit.
- fall under my [dni](https://rentry.co/dniscoffin)
- do **NOT** interact if you are the type to copy skins, do not copy my skins. *you may take inspo*, but ***DO NOT*** copy despite how "*simple*" my style is.
- if you are the type to **send death threats** or **harass people viciously instead of muting and blocking** like a normal mature person, ***i want nothing to do with you***. do better.
- please do not cover me if i do not know you. i will hide you if i feel/can tell its malicious.
- please do not compare my OC's to canonical characters from another media.

## **CONTINUED BOUNDARIES.ᐟ** ![mad](https://vermillion.drr.ac/assets/images/gallery01/2bc55952.gif?v=9b7c387b)
- i dont mind boops, but they are not a way to get my attention. if you want my attention, whisper me or speak, i usually dont respond to just "hi" though, be creative!
- i love crowns (👑) or compliments! feel free to! though, do it in whisper in case i dont see it (if you can)
- if you see my pony crying or whatever, you dont have to ask if im alright or why/whats wrong, i will likely ignore. _(adding this here because ive had enough people rapidly boop or just. clog my whispers. **please dont clog my whispers with nonsense**)_
